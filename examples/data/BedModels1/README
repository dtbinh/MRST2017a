  Numerical Aspects of Flow Based Local Upscaling
  Lars Vingli Ods√¶ter, NTNU, January 2013.


This directory contains models used for numerical computations in the thesis.

Contents:

Section 6.1:
  - simpleLayeredUniform.grdecl		Simple uniform layered model
  - non-periodicTilted.grdecl		Non-periodic tilted model
  - periodicTilted.grdecl		Periodic tilted model

Section 6.2:
  - testModel1.grdecl			Test model 1 (TM1)
  - testModel2.grdecl			Test model 2 (TM2)

Section 6.3:
  - file_list.txt			List of rock files for TM1*
  - rock_files/				Rock files containing input curves for TM1*

Section 6.4**:
  - mortarTestModel.grdecl		Realistic test model


* The rock files are also valid for TM2.

** The models referred to as 'simple uniform homogeneous model' and 
'simple uniform layered model' in the thesis, were constructed by 
routines provided by the OPM module dune-cornerpoint.
